This Budget continues our Government ’s efforts to:  \\na) accelerate growth,  \\nb) secure inclusive development,  \\nc) invigorate private sector investments,  \\nd) uplift household sentiments, and \\ne) enhance spending power of India’s rising middle class.  \\n2. Together, we embark on a journey to unlock our nation’s tremendous \\npotential for greater prosperity and global positioning under the leadership of \\nHon’ble Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi.  \\n3. As we complete the first quarter of the 21st century, continuing \\ngeopolitical headwinds suggest lower  global economic growth over the \\nmedium term. However, our aspiration for a Viksit Bharat inspires us, and the \\ntransformative work we have done during our Government ’s first two terms \\nguides us, to march forward resolutely.  \\nBudget Theme  \\n4. Our economy is the fastest -growing among all major global economies. \\nOur development track record of the past 10 years and structural reforms have \\ndrawn global attention. Confidence in India’s capability and potential has only  2  \\n \\ngrown in this period. We see the next five years as a unique opportunity to \\nrealize ‘Sabka Vikas’, stimulating balanced growth of all regions.  \\n5. The great Telugu poet and playwright Gurajada Appa Rao had said, \\n‘Desamante Matti Kaadoi, Desamante Manushuloi ’; meaning, ‘A country is not \\njust its soil, a country is its people.’ In line with this, for us, Viksit Bharat, \\nencompasses:  \\na) zero -poverty;  \\nb) hundred per cent good quality school education;   \\nc) access to high -quality, affordable, and comprehensive healthcare;  \\nd) hundred per cent skilled labour with meaningful employment;  \\ne) seventy per cent women in economic activities; and  \\nf) farmers making our country the ‘food basket of the world’.  \\n6. In this Budget, the proposed development measures span ten broad \\nareas focusing on Garib, Youth, Annadata and Nari.  \\n1) Spurring Agricultural Growth and Productivity;  \\n2) Building Rural Prosperity and Resilience;  \\n3) Taking Everyone Together on an Inclusive Growth path;  \\n4) Boosting Manufacturing and Furthering Make in India;  \\n5) Supporting MSMEs;  \\n6) Enabling Employment -led Development;  \\n7) Investing in people, economy and innovation;  \\n8) Securing Energy Supplies;  \\n9) Promoting Exports; and  \\n10) Nurturing Innovation . \\n7. For this journey of development,  \\na) Our four powerful engines are: Agriculture, MSME, Investment, and \\nExports  \\nb) The fuel: our Reforms  \\nc) Our guiding spirit: Inclusivity  \\nd) And the destination: Viksit Bharat   3  \\n \\n8. This Budget aims to initiate transformative reforms across six domains. \\nDuring the next five years, these will augment our growth potential and global \\ncompetitiveness. The domains are:  \\n1) Taxation;  \\n2) Power Sector;  \\n3) Urban Development;  \\n4) Mining;  \\n5) Financial Sector; and  \\n6) Regulatory Reforms.  \\nAgriculture as the 1st Engine  \\n9. Now I move to specific proposals, beginning with ‘Agriculture as the 1st \\nEngine’.  \\nPrime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana - Developing Agri Districts \\nProgramme  \\n10. Motivated by the success of the Aspirational Districts Programme, our \\nGovernment  will undertake a ‘Prime Minister Dhan -Dhaanya Krishi Yojana ’ in \\npartnership with states. Through the convergence of existing schemes and \\nspecialized measures, the programme will cover 100 districts with low \\nproductivity, moderate crop intensity and below -average credit parameters. It \\naims to (1) enhance agricultural  productivity, (2) adopt crop diversification and \\nsustainable agriculture practices, (3) augment post -harvest stor age at the \\npanchayat and block level, (4) improve irrigation facilities, and (5) facilitate \\navailability of long -term and short -term credit. This programme is likely to help \\n1.7 crore farmers.  \\nBuilding Rural Prosperity and Resilience  \\n11. A comprehensive multi -sectoral ‘Rural Prosperity and Resilience’ \\nprogramme will be launched in partnership with states. This will address under -\\nemployment in agriculture through skilling, investment, technology, and \\ninvigorating the rural economy. The goal  is to generate ample opportunities in \\nrural areas so that migration is an option, but not a necessity.  \\n12. The programme will focus on rural women, young farmers, rural youth, \\nmarginal and small farmers, and landless families. Details are in Annexure A.   4  \\n \\n13. Global and domestic best practices will be incorporated and \\nappropriate technical and financial assistance will be sought from multilateral \\ndevelopment banks. In Phase -1, 100 developing agri -districts will be covered.   \\nAatmanirbharta in Pulses    \\n14. Our Government  is implementing the National Mission for Edible \\nOilseed for achieving atmanirbhrata in edible oils. Our farmers have the \\ncapability to grow enough for our needs and more.  \\n15. Ten years ago, we made concerted efforts and succeeded in achieving \\nnear self -sufficiency in pulses. Farmers responded to the need by increasing the \\ncultivated area by 50 per cent and Government  arranged for procurement and \\nremunerative prices. Since then, with rising incomes and better affordability, \\nour consumption of pulses has increased significantly.  \\n16. Our Government  will now launch a 6 -year “Mission for Aatmanirbharta \\nin Pulses” with a special focus on Tur, Urad and Masoor.  Details are in \\nAnnexure B. Central agencies (NAFED and NCCF) will be ready to procure these \\n3 pulses, as much as offered during the next 4 years  from farmers who register \\nwith these agencies and enter into agreements.   \\nComprehensive Programme for Vegetables & Fruits  \\n17. It is encouraging that our people are increasingly becoming aware of \\ntheir nutritional needs. It is a sign of a society becoming healthier. With rising \\nincome levels, the consumption of vegetables, fruits and shree -anna is \\nincreasing significantly. A compr ehensive programme to promote production, \\nefficient supplies, processing, and remunerative prices for farmers will be \\nlaunched in partnership with states. Appropriate institutional mechanisms for \\nimplementation and participation of farmer producer organiza tions and \\ncooperatives will be set up.   \\nMakhana Board in Bihar  \\n18. For this, there is a special opportunity for the people of Bihar. A \\nMakhana Board will be established in the state to improve production, \\nprocessing, value addition, and marketing of makhana. The people engaged in \\nthese activities will be organized into FP Os. The Board will provide handholding \\nand training support to makhana farmers and will also work to ensure they \\nreceive the benefits of all relevant Government  schemes.     5  \\n \\nNational Mission on High Yielding Seeds  \\n19. A National Mission on High Yielding Seeds will be launched, aimed at (1) \\nstrengthening the research ecosystem, (2) targeted development and \\npropagation of seeds with high yield, pest resistance and climate resilience, and \\n(3) commercial availability of mor e than 100 seed varieties released since July \\n2024.  \\nFisheries  \\n20. India ranks second -largest globally in fish production and aquaculture. \\nSeafood exports are valued at ` 60 thousand crore. To unlock the untapped \\npotential of the marine sector, our Government  will bring in an enabling \\nframework for sustainable harnessing of fisheries from Indian Exclusive \\nEconomic Zone and High Seas, with a special focus on the Andaman & Nicobar \\nand Lakshadweep Islands.  \\nMission for Cotton Productivity  \\n21. For the benefit of lakhs of cotton growing farmers, I am pleased to \\nannounce a ‘Mission for Cotton Productivity’. This 5 -year mission will facilitate \\nsignificant improvements in productivity and sustainability of cotton farming, \\nand promote extra -long stap le cotton varieties. The best of science & \\ntechnology support will be provided to farmers. Aligned with our integrated 5F \\nvision for the textile sector, this will help in increasing incomes of the farmers, \\nand ensure a steady supply of quality cotton for r ejuvenating India’s traditional \\ntextile sector.  \\nEnhanced Credit through KCC  \\n22. Kisan Credit Cards (KCC) facilitate short term loans for 7.7 crore farmers, \\nfishermen, and dairy farmers. The loan limit under the Modified Interest \\nSubvention Scheme will be enhanced from ` 3 lakh to 5 lakh for loans taken \\nthrough the KCC.   \\nUrea Plant in Assam  \\n23. For Atmanirbharta in urea production, our Government  had reopened \\nthree dormant urea plants in the Eastern region. To further augment urea \\nsupply, a plant with annual capacity of 12.7 lakh metric tons will be set up at \\nNamrup, Assam.  \\nIndia Post as a Catalyst for the Rural Economy  \\n24. India Post with 1.5 lakh rural post offices, complemented by the India \\nPost Payment Bank and a vast network of 2.4 lakh Dak Sevaks, will be \\nrepositioned to act as a catalyst for the rural economy. Details are at \\nAnnexure C.   6  \\n \\n25. India Post will also be transformed as a large public logistics \\norganization. This will meet the rising needs of Viswakarmas, new \\nentrepreneurs, women, self -help groups, MSMEs, and large business \\norganizations.  \\nSupport to NCDC  \\n26. Our Government  will provide support to NCDC for its lending operations \\nfor the cooperative sector.  \\nMSMEs as the 2nd engine  \\n27. Now, I move to MSMEs as the 2nd engine, which encompasses \\nmanufacturing and services with a focus on MSMEs  numbering 5.7 crore . \\nRevision in classification criteria for MSMEs  \\n28. Currently, over 1 crore registered MSMEs, employing 7.5 crore people, \\nand generating 36 per cent of our manufacturing, have come together to \\nposition India as a global manufacturing hub. With their quality products, \\nthese MSMEs are responsible for 45 per c ent of our exports. To help them \\nachieve higher efficiencies of scale, technological upgradation and better \\naccess to capital, the investment and turnover limits for classification of all \\nMSMEs will be enhanced to 2.5 and 2 times respectively. This will gi ve them \\nthe confidence to grow and generate employment for our youth. The details \\nare in Annexure D.  \\nSignificant enhancement of credit availability with guarantee cover  \\n29. To improve access to credit, the credit guarantee cover will be \\nenhanced : \\na) For Micro and Small Enterprises, from ` 5 crore to 10 crore, leading \\nto additional credit of ` 1.5 lakh crore in the next 5 years;  \\nb) For Startups, from ` 10 crore to 20 crore, with the guarantee fee \\nbeing moderated to 1 per cent for loans in 27 focus sectors \\nimportant for Atmanirbhar Bharat; and  \\nc) For well -run exporter MSMEs, for term loans up to ` 20 crore.  \\nCredit Cards for Micro Enterprises  \\n30. We will introduce customized Credit Cards with a ` 5 lakh limit for micro \\nenterprises registered on Udyam portal. In the first year, 10 lakh such cards will \\nbe issued.   7  \\n \\nFund of Funds for Startups  \\n31. The Alternate Investment Funds (AIFs) for startups have received \\ncommitments of more than ` 91,000 crore. These are supported by the Fund \\nof Funds set up with a Government  contribution of ` 10,000 crore. Now, a new \\nFund of Funds, with expanded scope and a fresh contribution of another  \\n` 10,000 crore will be set up.  \\nScheme for First -time Entrepreneurs  \\n32. A new scheme will be launched for 5 lakh women, Scheduled Castes and \\nScheduled Tribes first -time entrepreneurs. This will provide term loans up  \\nto ` 2 crore during the next 5 years. The scheme will incorporate lessons from \\nthe successful Stand -Up India scheme. Online capacity building for \\nentrepreneurship and managerial skills will also be organized.     \\nMeasures for Labour -Intensive Sectors      \\n33. To promote employment and entrepreneurship opportunities in \\nlabour -intensive sectors, our Government  will undertake specific policy and  \\nfacilitation measures.  \\nFocus Product Scheme for Footwear & Leather Sectors  \\n34. To enhance the productivity, quality and competitiveness  of India’s \\nfootwear and leather sector, a focus product scheme will be implemented. The \\nscheme will support design capacity, component manufacturing, and \\nmachinery required for production of non -leather quality footwear, besides the \\nsupport for leather foo twear and products. The scheme is expected to facilitate \\nemployment for 22 lakh persons, generate turnover of ` 4 lakh crore and \\nexports of over ` 1.1 lakh crore.  \\nMeasures for the Toy Sector  \\n35. Building on the National Action Plan for Toys, we will implement a \\nscheme to make India a global hub for toys. The scheme will focus on \\ndevelopment of clusters, skills, and a manufacturing ecosystem  that will create \\nhigh -quality, unique, innovative, and sustainable toys that will represent the \\n\\'Made in India\\' brand.  \\nSupport for Food Processing  \\n36. In line with our commitment towards ‘Purvodaya ’, we will establish a \\nNational Institute of Food Technology, Entrepreneurship and Management in \\nBihar. The institute will provide a strong fillip to food processing activities in  8  \\n \\nthe entire Eastern region. This will result in (1) enhanced income for the \\nfarmers through value addition to their produce, and (2) skilling, \\nentrepreneurship and employment opportunities for the youth.  \\nManufacturing Mission - Furthering “Make in India”  \\n37. Our Government  will set up a National Manufacturing Mission covering \\nsmall, medium and large industries for furthering “Make in India” by providing \\npolicy support, execution roadmaps, governance and monitoring framework \\nfor central ministries and states. Details are in Annexure E.  \\nClean Tech Manufacturing  \\n38. Given our commitment to climate -friendly development, the Mission \\nwill also support Clean Tech manufacturing. This will aim to improve domestic \\nvalue addition and build our ecosystem for solar PV cells, EV batteries, motors \\nand controllers, electrolyzers, wind turbines, very high voltage transmission \\nequipment and grid scale batteries.   \\nInvestment as the 3rd engine  \\n39. Now, I move to Investment as the 3rd engine, which encompasses \\ninvesting in people, investing in the economy and investing in innovation.  \\nA. Investing in People  \\nSaksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0  \\n40. The Saksham Anganwadi and Poshan 2.0 programme provides \\nnutritional support to more than 8 crore children, 1 crore pregnant women and \\nlactating mothers all over the country, and about 20 lakh adolescent girls in \\naspirational districts and the north -east re gion. The cost norms for the \\nnutritional support will be enhanced appropriately.  \\nAtal Tinkering Labs  \\n41. Fifty thousand Atal Tinkering Labs will be set up in Government  schools \\nin next 5 years to cultivate the spirit of curiosity and innovation, and foster a \\nscientific temper among young minds.  \\nBroadband Connectivity to Government Secondary Schools and PHCs  \\n42. Broadband connectivity will be provided to all Government  secondary \\nschools and primary health centres in rural areas under the Bharatnet project.   9  \\n \\nBharatiya Bhasha Pustak Scheme  \\n43. We propose to implement a Bharatiya Bhasha Pustak Scheme to \\nprovide digital -form Indian language books for school and higher education. \\nThis aims to help students understand their subjects better.  \\nNational Centres of Excellence for Skilling  \\n44. Building on the initiative announced in the July 2024 Budget, five \\nNational Centres of Excellence for skilling will be set up with global expertise \\nand partnerships to equip our youth with the skills required for “Make for India, \\nMake for the World” manufa cturing. The partnerships will cover curriculum \\ndesign, training of trainers, a skills certification framework, and periodic \\nreviews.  \\nExpansion of Capacity in IITs  \\n45. Total number of students in 23 IITs has increased 100 per cent from \\n65,000 to 1.35 lakh in the past 10 years. Additional infrastructure will be \\ncreated in the 5 IITs started after 2014 to facilitate education for 6,500 more \\nstudents. Hostel and other infra structure capacity at IIT, Patna will also be \\nexpanded.  \\nCentre of Excellence in AI for Education  \\n46. I had announced three Centres of Excellence in Artificial Intelligence for \\nagriculture,  health,  and sustainable cities in 2023.

In the next  year, \\n10,000  additional seats will be added in medical colleges and hospitals, towards \\nthe goal of adding 75,000 seats in the next 5 years.  \\nDay Care Cancer Centres in all District Hospitals   \\n48. Our Government  will facilitate setting up of Day Care Cancer Centres \\nin all district hospitals in the next 3 years. 200 Centres will be established in \\n2025 -26.   10  \\n \\nStrengthening urban livelihoods  \\n49. Our Government  has been giving priority to assisting urban poor and \\nvulnerable groups. A scheme for socio -economic upliftment of urban workers \\nwill be implemented to help them improve their incomes, have sustainable \\nlivelihoods and a better quality of life.    \\nPM SVANidhi  \\n50. PM SVANidhi scheme has benefitted more than 68 lakh street vendors \\ngiving them respite from high -interest informal sector loans. Building on this \\nsuccess, the scheme will be revamped with enhanced loans from banks, UPI \\nlinked credit cards with ` 30,000 limit, and capacity building support.  \\nSocial Security Scheme for Welfare of Online Platform Workers  \\n51.

Medical Tourism and Heal in India will be promoted in partnership with \\nthe private sector along with capacity building and easier visa norms.  \\nC. Investing in Innovation  \\nResearch, Development and Innovation  \\n79. To implement private sector driven Research, Development and \\nInnovation initiative announced in the July Budget, I am now allocating  \\n` 20,000 crore.   \\nDeep Tech Fund of Funds  \\n80. A Deep Tech Fund of Funds will also be explored to catalyze the next \\ngeneration startups as a part of this initiative.  \\nPM Research Fellowship  \\n81. In the next five years, under the PM Research Fellowship scheme, we \\nwill provide ten thousand fellowships for technological research in IITs and IISc \\nwith enhanced financial support.  \\nGene Bank for Crops Germplasm  \\n82. The 2nd Gene Bank with 10 lakh germplasm lines will be set up for future \\nfood and nutritional security. This will provide conservation support to both \\npublic and private sectors for genetic resources.   \\nNational Geospatial Mission  \\n83.

Now, I move to Exports as the 4th engine.   \\nExports as the 4th engine  \\nExport Promotion Mission  \\n86. We will set up an Export Promotion Mission, with sectoral and \\nministerial targets, driven jointly by the Ministries of Commerce, MSME, and \\nFinance. It will facilitate easy access to export credit, cross -border factoring \\nsupport, and support to MSMEs to tac kle non -tariff measures in overseas \\nmarkets.  \\nBharatTradeNet  \\n87. A digital public infrastructure, ‘BharatTradeNet’ (BTN) for international \\ntrade will be set -up as a unified platform for trade documentation and \\nfinancing solutions. This will complement the Unified Logistics Interface \\nPlatform. The BTN will be aligned wit h international practices.  \\nSupport for integration with Global Supply Chains  \\n88. Support will be provided to develop domestic manufacturing capacities \\nfor our economy’s integration with global supply chains. Sectors will be \\nidentified based on objective criteria.  \\n89. Facilitation groups with participation of senior officers and industry \\nrepresentatives will be formed for select products and supply chains.  \\n90.  Through this, there are huge opportunities related to Industry 4.0, \\nwhich needs high skills and talent. Our youth have both. Our Government  will \\nsupport the domestic electronic equipment industry to leverage this \\nopportunity for the benefit of the youth.  \\nNational Framework for GCC  \\n91. A national framework will be formulated as guidance to states for \\npromoting Global Capability Centres in emerging tier 2 cities. This will suggest  16  \\n \\nmeasures for enhancing availability of talent and infrastructure, building -\\nbyelaw reforms, and mechanisms for collaboration with industry.  \\nWarehousing facility for air cargo  \\n92. Our Government will facilitate upgradation of infrastructure and \\nwarehousing for air cargo including high value perishable horticulture produce. \\nCargo screening and customs protocols will be streamlined and made user -\\nfriendly.      \\nReforms as the Fuel  \\n93. Now I move to ‘Reforms as the Fuel’, and detail specific reforms.  \\nTax Reforms  \\n94. Over the past 10 years, our Government  has implemented several \\nreforms for convenience of tax payers, such as (1) faceless assessment, (2) tax \\npayers charter, (3) faster returns, (4) almost 99 per cent returns being on self -\\nassessment, and (5) Vivad se Vishwas scheme. Continuing these efforts,   \\nI reaffirm the commitment of the tax department to “trust first, scrutinize later”. \\nI also propose to introduce the new income -tax bill next week. I will detail the \\nindirect tax reforms and changes in direct taxes in Part B.   \\nFinancial Sector Reforms and Development  \\nFDI in Insurance Sector  \\n95. The FDI limit for the insurance sector will be raised from 74 to 100 per \\ncent. This enhanced limit will be available for those companies which invest the \\nentire premium in India. The current guardrails and conditionalities associated \\nwith foreign investmen t will be reviewed and simplified.  \\nExpanding Services of India Post Payment Bank  \\n96. The services of India Post Payment Bank will be deepened and \\nexpanded in rural areas.  \\nCredit Enhancement Facility by NaBFID  \\n97. NaBFID will set up a ‘Partial Credit Enhancement Facility’ for corporate \\nbonds for infrastructure.  \\nGrameen Credit Score  \\n98. Public Sector Banks will develop ‘Grameen Credit Score’ framework to \\nserve the credit needs of SHG members and people in rural areas.   17  \\n \\nPension Sector  \\n99. A forum for regulatory coordination and development of pension \\nproducts will be set up.  \\nKYC Simplification  \\n100. To implement the earlier announcement on simplifying the KYC \\nprocess, the revamped Central KYC Registry will be rolled out in 2025. We will \\nalso implement a streamlined system for periodic updating.  \\nMerger of Companies  \\n101. Requirements and procedures for speedy approval of company mergers \\nwill be rationalized. The scope for fast -track mergers will also be widened and \\nthe process made simpler.  \\nBilateral Investment Treaties  \\n102. As proposed in the Interim Budget, we signed Bilateral Investment \\nTreaties (BIT) with two countries in 2024. To encourage sustained foreign \\ninvestment and in the spirit of ‘first develop India’, the current model BIT will \\nbe revamped and made more investor -friendly.  \\nRegulatory Reforms  \\n103. In the last ten years in several aspects, including financial and non -\\nfinancial, our Government  has demonstrated a steadfast commitment to ‘Ease \\nof Doing Business’. We are determined to ensure that our regulations must \\nkeep up with technological innovations and global policy developments. A \\nlight -touch regulatory framework based on principles and tr ust will unleash \\nproductivity and employment. Through this framework, we will update \\nregulations that were made under old laws. To develop this modern, flexible,  \\npeople -friendly, and trust -based regulatory framework appropriate for the \\ntwenty -first century, I propose four specific measures:  \\nHigh Level Committee for Regulatory Reforms  \\n104. A High -Level Committee for Regulatory Reforms will be set up for a \\nreview of all non -financial sector regulations, certifications, licenses, and \\npermissions. The committee will be expected make recommendations within a  18  \\n \\nyear. The objective is to strengthen trust -based economic governance and take \\ntransformational measures to enhance ‘ease of doing business’, especially in \\nmatters of inspections and compliances.  States will be encouraged to join in \\nthis endeavour.  \\nInvestment Friendliness Index of States  \\n105. An Investment Friendliness Index of States will be launched in 2025 to \\nfurther the spirit of competitive cooperative federalism.  \\nFSDC Mechanism  \\n106. Under the Financial Stability and Development Council, a mechanism \\nwill be set up to evaluate impact of the current financial regulations and \\nsubsidiary instructions. It will also formulate a framework to enhance their \\nresponsiveness and development of the  financial sector.  \\nJan Vishwas Bill 2.0  \\n107. In the Jan Vishwas Act 2023, more than 180 legal provisions were \\ndecriminalized. Our Government  will now bring up the Jan Vishwas Bill 2.0 to \\ndecriminalize more than 100 provisions in various laws.   \\nFiscal Policy  \\n108. Now I move to fiscal policy matters.  \\nFiscal Consolidation  \\n109. In the July Budget, I had committed to staying the course for fiscal \\nconsolidation. Our endeavour will be to keep the fiscal deficit each year such \\nthat the Central Government debt remains on a declining path as a percentage \\nof the GDP. The roadmap for the  next 6 years has been detailed in the FRBM \\nstatement.           \\nRevised Estimates 2024 -25 \\n110. The Revised  Estimate  of the total  receipts  other  than  borrowings  is  \\n` 31.47  lakh crore,  of which  the net tax receipts are ` 25.57  lakh crore. The \\nRevised Estimate of the total expenditure is ` 47.16  lakh crore,  of which the  \\ncapital  expenditure  is about  ` 10.18  lakh crore.  \\n111. The Revised Estimate of the fiscal deficit is 4.8 per cent of GDP.   19  \\n \\nBudget Estimates 2025 -26 \\n112. Coming to 2025 -26, the total receipts other than  borrowings  and the \\ntotal expenditure are estimated at ` 34.96  lakh crore and ` 50.65  lakh crore \\nrespectively. The net tax receipts are estimated at ` 28.37  lakh crore.  \\n113. The fiscal  deficit  is estimated  to be 4.4 per cent  of GDP . \\n114. To finance the fiscal deficit, the net market borrowings from dated \\nsecurities are estimated at ` 11.54 lakh crore. The balance financing is expected \\nto come from small savings and other sources. The gross market borrowings \\nare estimated at ` 14.8 2 lakh crore.  \\nI will now move  to Part  B. \\n \\n   20  \\n \\nPART B  \\nIndirect Taxes  \\n115. My proposals relating to Customs aim to rationalize tariff structure and \\naddress duty inversion. These will also support domestic manufacturing and \\nvalue addition, promote exports, facilitate trade and provide relief to common \\npeople.  \\nRationalisation of Customs Tariff Structure for Industrial Goods  \\n116. As a part of comprehensive review of Customs rate structure \\nannounced in July 2024 Budget, I propose to:  \\n(i) remove seven tariff rates. This is over and above the seven tariff \\nrates removed in 2023 -24 budget. After this, there will be only eight \\nremaining tariff rates including ‘zero’ rate.  \\n(ii) apply appropriate cess to broadly maintain effective duty incidence \\nexcept on a few items, where such incidence will reduce marginally.  \\n(iii) levy not more than one cess or surcharge. Therefore, I propose to \\nexempt Social Welfare Surcharge on 82 tariff lines that are subject \\nto a cess.  \\n117. I shall now take up sector specific proposals.  \\nRelief on import of Drugs/Medicines  \\n118.  To provide relief to patients, particularly those suffering from cancer, \\nrare diseases and other severe chronic diseases, I propose to add 36 lifesaving \\ndrugs and medicines to the list of medicines fully exempted from Basic Customs \\nDuty (BCD).  I also pro pose to add 6 lifesaving medicines to the list attracting \\nconcessional customs duty of 5%. Full exemption and concessional duty will \\nalso respectively apply on the bulk drugs for manufacture of the above.  \\n119. Specified drugs and medicines under Patient Assistance Programmes \\nrun by pharmaceutical companies are fully exempt from BCD, provided the \\nmedicines are supplied free of cost to patients. I propose to add 37 more \\nmedicines along with 13 new patient assistance programmes.   21  \\n \\nSupport to Domestic Manufacturing and Value addition  \\nCritical Minerals  \\n120. In the July 2024 Budget, I had fully exempted BCD on 25 critical minerals \\nthat are not domestically available. I had also reduced BCD of 2 other such \\nminerals to provide a major fillip to their processing especially by MSMEs. Now, \\nI propose to fully exempt  cobalt powder and waste, the scrap of lithium -ion \\nbattery, Lead, Zinc and 12 more critical minerals. This will help secure their \\navailability for manufacturing in India and promote more jobs for our youth.  \\nTextiles  \\n121.  To promote domestic production of technical textile products such as \\nagro -textiles, medical textiles and geo textiles at competitive prices, I propose \\nto add two more types of shuttle -less looms to the list of fully exempted textile \\nmachinery.  I also pro pose to revise the BCD rate on knitted fabrics covered by \\nnine tariff lines from “10% or 20%” to “20% or ` 115 per kg, whichever is \\nhigher”.  \\nElectronic Goods  \\n122. In line with our ‘Make in India’ policy, and to rectify inverted duty \\nstructure, I propose to increase the BCD on Interactive Flat Panel Display (IFPD) \\nfrom 10% to 20% and reduce the BCD to 5% on Open Cell and other \\ncomponents.  \\n123. In 2023 -24 Budget, for the manufacture of Open Cells of LCD/LED TVs, \\nI had reduced the BCD on parts of Open Cells from 5% to 2.5% . To further boost \\nthe manufacture of such Open Cells, the BCD on these parts will now stand \\nexempted.  \\nLithium Ion Battery  \\n124. To the list of exempted capital goods, I propose to add 35 additional \\ncapital goods for EV battery manufacturing, and 28 additional capital goods for \\nmobile phone battery manufacturing. This will boost domestic manufacture of \\nlithium -ion battery, both for mobile phones and electric vehicles.  \\nShipping Sector  \\n125.  Considering that shipbuilding has a long gestation period, I propose to \\ncontinue the exemption of BCD on raw materials, components, consumables \\nor parts for the manufacture of ships for another ten years. I also propose the \\nsame dispensation for ship break ing to make it more competitive.   22  \\n \\nTelecommunication  \\n126. To prevent classification disputes, I propose to reduce the BCD from \\n20% to 10% on Carrier Grade ethernet switches to make it at par with Non -\\nCarrier Grade ethernet switches.  \\nExport Promotion  \\nHandicraft Goods  \\n127.  To facilitate exports of handicrafts, I propose to extend the time period \\nfor export from six months to one year, further extendable by another three \\nmonths, if required. I also propose to add nine items to the list of duty -free \\ninputs.  \\nLeather sector  \\n128.   I propose to fully exempt BCD on Wet Blue leather to facilitate imports \\nfor domestic value addition and employment. I also propose to exempt crust \\nleather from 20% export duty to facilitate exports by small tanners.  \\nMarine products  \\n129.  To enhance India\\'s competitiveness in the global seafood market, I \\npropose to reduce BCD from 30% to 5% on  Frozen Fish Paste (Surimi) for \\nmanufacture and export of its analogue products. I also propose to reduce BCD \\nfrom 15% to 5% on fish hydrolysate for manufacture of fish and   shrimp feeds.  \\nDomestic MROs for Railway Goods  \\n130.  In July 2024 Budget, to promote development of domestic MROs for \\naircraft and ships, I had extended the time limit for export of foreign origin \\ngoods that were imported for repairs, from 6 months to one year and further \\nextendable by one year.  I now pro pose to extend the same dispensation for \\nrailway goods.  \\n \\nTrade facilitation  \\nTime limit for Provisional Assessment  \\n131.  Presently, the Customs Act, 1962 does not provide any time limit to \\nfinalize Provisional Assessments leading to uncertainty and cost to trade. As a \\nmeasure of promoting ease of doing business, I propose to fix a time -limit of \\ntwo years, extendable by a y ear, for finalising the provisional assessment.   23  \\n \\n Voluntary Compliance  \\n132.  I propose to introduce a new provision that will enable importers or \\nexporters, after clearance of goods, to voluntarily declare material facts and \\npay duty with interest but without penalty. This will incentivise voluntary \\ncompliance.  However, this wil l not apply in cases where department has \\nalready initiated audit or investigation proceedings.  \\nExtended Time for End Use  \\n133. For industry to better plan their imports, I propose to extend the time \\nlimit for the end -use of imported inputs in the relevant rules, from six months \\nto one year. This will provide operational flexibility in view of cost and \\nuncertainty of supply. Furth er, such importers will now have to file only \\nquarterly statements instead of a monthly statement.  \\n \\nDirect Taxes  \\nI now come to my Direct tax proposals.  \\n134.  In Part A, I have briefly underlined Taxation Reforms as one of key \\nreforms to realize our vision of Viksit Bharat.  In respect of criminal law, Our \\nGovernment had earlier ushered in Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita replacing \\nBharatiya Danda Sanhita. I am happy to inform this August House and the \\ncountry that the new income -tax bill will carry forward the same spirit of \\n“Nyaya”. The new bill will be clear and direct in text with close to half of the \\npresent law, in terms of both chapters and words. It will be simple to \\nunderstand for taxpayers and tax administration, leading to tax certainty and \\nreduced litigation.   \\n135. Reforms, however, are not a destination. They are a means to achieve \\ngood governance for our people and economy. Providing good governance \\nprimarily involves being responsive. The Thirukkural captures this in Verse 542, \\nwhich reads:  \\nவான ாக்கி  வாழும்  உலககல்லாம்  ம ் வ ்  \\nனகால்ன ாக்கி  வாழுங் குடி. \\nvaanokki vaalum ulakellaam mannavan  \\nkoalnokki vaalung kuti  \\nMeaning:  \\nJust as living beings live expecting rains,  \\nCitizens live expecting good governance.   24  \\n \\nOur Government  is committed to keeping an ear to the ground and a finger on \\nthe pulse, and responding while balancing our nation -building efforts. The \\nfollowing measures will detail just how our Government  under the guidance of \\nPM Modi has taken steps to understand and address the needs voiced by our \\ncitizens. My tax proposals are guided by this spirit.  \\n136. The objectives of my proposals are as follows:  \\n(i) Personal Income Tax reforms with special focus on middle class  \\n(ii) Rationalization of TDS/TCS for easing difficulties  \\n(iii) Encouraging voluntary compliance  \\n(iv) Reducing compliance burden  \\n(v) Ease of doing business  \\n(vi) Employment and investment  \\nI will come to my proposal on personal income tax towards the end.  \\nTDS/TCS rationalization for easing difficulties  \\n137. I propose to rationalize Tax Deduction at Source (TDS) by reducing the \\nnumber of rates and thresholds above which TDS is deducted. Further, \\nthreshold amounts for tax deduction will be increased for better clarity and \\nuniformity. The limit for tax deduction  on interest for senior citizens is being  \\ndoubled from the present ` 50,000 to ` 1 lakh. Similarly, the annual limit of ` \\n2.40 lakh for TDS on rent is being  increased to ` 6 lakh. This will reduce the \\nnumber of transactions liable to TDS, thus benefitting small tax payers \\nreceiving small payments.  \\n138. The threshold to collect tax at source (TCS) on remittances under RBI’s \\nLiberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS)  is proposed to be  increased from ` 7 lakh \\nto ` 10 lakh. I also propose to remove TCS on remittances for education \\npurposes, where such remittance is out of a loan taken from a specified \\nfinancial institution.  \\n139. Both TDS and TCS  are being applied on any transaction relating to sale \\nof goods. To prevent such compliance difficulties, I propose to omit the TCS. I \\nalso propose that the provisions of the higher TDS deduction will now apply \\nonly in non -PAN cases.   25  \\n \\n140.  In July 2024, the delay for payment of TDS up to the due date of filing \\nstatement was decriminalized. I propose to provide the same relaxation to TCS \\nprovisions as well.  \\nEncouraging Voluntary Compliance  \\n141. The Government under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi believes \\nin “Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas, Sabka Vishwas and Sabka Prayas”. In line with \\nthis, we brought in updated return facility in 2022 for voluntary compliance by \\ntaxpayers who had omitted to report their correct income. Our trust in \\ntaxpayers was proved right. Nearly 90 lakh taxpayers voluntarily updated their \\nincomes by paying addition al tax. Taking this trust further, I now propose to \\nextend the time -limit to file updated returns  for any assessment year , from the \\ncurrent limit of two years, to four years.  \\nReducing Compliance Burden  \\n142. I propose to reduce the compliance burden for small charitable \\ntrusts/institutions by increasing their period of registration from 5 years to 10 \\nyears. It is also proposed that disproportionate consequences do not arise for \\nminor defaults, such as incomple te applications filed by charitable entities.  \\n143. Presently tax -payers can claim the annual value of self -occupied \\nproperties as nil only on the fulfilment of certain conditions. Considering the \\ndifficulties faced by taxpayers, it is proposed to allow the benefit of two such \\nself-occupied properties witho ut any condition.  \\nEase of Doing Business  \\n144. To streamline the process of transfer pricing and to provide an \\nalternative to yearly examination, I propose to introduce a scheme for \\ndetermining arm\\'s length price of international transaction for a block period \\nof three years. This will be in line with global best practices.  \\n145. With a view to reduce litigation and provide certainty in international \\ntaxation, the scope of safe harbour rules is being expanded.    \\n146. A number of senior and very senior citizens have very old National \\nSavings Scheme accounts. As interest is no longer payable on such accounts, I \\npropose to exempt withdrawals made from NSS by individuals on or after the \\n29th of August, 2024. I am also prop osing to allow similar treatment to NPS \\nVatsalya accounts as is available to normal NPS accounts, subject to overall \\nlimits.   26  \\n \\n147. In my speech in July 2024, I had promised that all processes including \\ngiving effect to appellate orders shall be digitalized and made paper -less over \\nthe next two years. I am happy to announce that digitalization is being made \\noperational.  \\n148. In July 2024, we brought in the Vivad Se Vishwas Scheme to resolve \\nincome tax disputes pending in appeal. The scheme has received a great \\nresponse, with nearly 33,000 tax payers having availed of this scheme to settle \\ntheir disputes.  \\nEmployment and Investment  \\n149. I have a few proposals to promote investment and employment.  \\nTax certainty for electronics manufacturing Schemes  \\n150. It is proposed to provide a presumptive taxation regime for non -\\nresidents who provide services to a resident company that is establishing or \\noperating an electronics manufacturing facility. I further propose to introduce \\na safe harbour for tax certainty fo r non -residents who store components for \\nsupply to specified electronics manufacturing units.  \\nTonnage Tax Scheme for Inland Vessels  \\n151. Presently the tonnage tax scheme is available to only sea going ships. \\nThe benefits of existing tonnage tax scheme are proposed to be extended to \\ninland vessels registered under the Indian Vessels Act, 2021 to promote inland \\nwater transport in the country.  \\nExtension for incorporation of Start -Ups \\n152. We continue to support the Indian start -up eco -system. I propose to \\nextend the period of incorporation by 5 years to allow the benefit available to \\nstart -ups which are incorporated before 1.4.2030.  \\nInternational Financial Services Centre (IFSC)  \\n153. In order to attract and promote additional activities in the IFSC, I am \\ninter alia  proposing specific benefits to ship -leasing units, insurance offices and \\ntreasury centres of global companies which are set up in IFSC.  Further, to claim \\nbenefits, the cut -off date for commencement in IFSC has also been extended \\nby five years to 31.3.203 0.  27  \\n \\nAlternate Investment Funds (AIFs)  \\n154. Category I and category II AIFs are undertaking investments in \\ninfrastructure and other such sectors. I propose to provide certainty of \\ntaxation to these entities on the gains from securities.  \\nExtension of investment date for Sovereign and Pension Funds  \\n155. To promote funding from Sovereign Wealth Funds and Pension Funds \\nto the infrastructure sector, I propose to extend the date of making an \\ninvestment by five more years, to 31st March, 2030.  \\nPersonal Income - tax Reforms with special focus on middle class  \\n156. Democracy, Demography and Demand are the key support pillars in our \\njourney towards Viksit Bharat. The middle class provides strength for India’s \\ngrowth. This Government  under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi has \\nalways believed in the admirable energy and ability of the middle class in \\nnation building. In recognition of their contribution, we have periodically \\nreduced their tax burden. Right after 2014, the ‘Nil tax ’ slab was raised to  \\n` 2.5 lakh, which was further raised to ` 5 lakh in 2019 and to ` 7 lakh in 2023. \\nThis is reflective of our Government ’s trust on the middle -class tax payers. I am \\nnow happy to announce that there will be no income tax payable up to income \\nof ` 12 lakh (i.e. average income of ` 1 lakh per month other than special rate \\nincome  such as capital gains ) under the new regime. This limit will be ` 12.75 \\nlakh for salaried tax payers, due to standard deduction of ` 75,000.  \\n157. Slabs and rates are being changed across the board to benefit all tax -\\npayers. The new structure will substantially reduce the taxes of the middle \\nclass and leave more money in their hands, boosting household consumption, \\nsavings and investment.  \\n158.  In the new tax regime, I propose to revise tax rate structure as follows:  \\n0-4 lakh rupees  Nil \\n4-8 lakh rupees  5 per cent  \\n8-12 lakh rupees  10 per cent  \\n12-16 lakh rupees  15 per cent  \\n16-20 lakh rupees  20 per cent  \\n20- 24 lakh rupees  25 per cent  \\nAbove 24 lakh rupees  30 per cent   28  \\n \\n159. To tax payers upto ` 12 lakh of normal income (other than special rate \\nincome  such as capital gains ) tax rebate is being provided in addition to the \\nbenefit due to slab rate reduction in such a manner that there is no tax payable \\nby them.

A person having income of ` 18 lakh will \\nget a benefit of ` 70,000 in tax (30% of tax payable as per existing  rates).  \\nA person with an income of ` 25 lakh gets a benefit of ` 1,10,000 (25% of his \\ntax payable as per existing  rates).  \\n160.
